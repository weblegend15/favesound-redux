## Contribute

Feel free to contribute to that project!

Looking forward whether someone is able to wrap it into an electron app or extend it by react native.

I want to provide an amazing experience for artists to find new music with the help of their own profile and surroundings like followers, followings etc. This is just the beginning :)
