## Contribute

I am looking actively for contributors to make this project awesome! It doesn't matter if you are new to open source, I would welcome it!

I wouldn't want to extend the project with new routes like: that's my profile page and that's my favorite track page. Rather I see more value in improving the status quo of the app: Improving the player, the playlist or the interaction overall. I would love to see a GitHub issue to see where you want to work on. Moreover I will try to find the time to raise some more issues where people can contribute. At the end it is a perfect project to get started in open source!

## Future

I want to provide an amazing experience for artists to find new music with the help of their own profile and surroundings like followers, followings etc. This is just the beginning :)
